 Question 10, concurrency
 This is the second of two scripts that tests that the BryanAir database can handle concurrency.
 This script sets up a valid reservation and tries to pay for it in such a way that at most
 one such booking should be possible (or the plane will run out of seats). This script should
 be run in both terminals, in parallel.
