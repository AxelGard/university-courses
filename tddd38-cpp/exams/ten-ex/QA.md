*Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the class hierarchy in the previous assignment*

**Answer:** I would say that the code is quite readable due to each method only being a few lines of code. 
There is some rows that when you first see you might not emigatly realize what they doo. 
For example `static_cast<bool>(iss >> this->data);` but it is not to bad. 

due to the classes making use of abstract classes it would not be to hard to add Float or simular. Or if one wanted to even expand even more one could make the serilizeble class a tamplate class thus supporting many more types then int.
